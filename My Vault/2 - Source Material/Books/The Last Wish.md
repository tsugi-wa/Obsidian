Description: My analysis of The Last Wish

##### The Introduction of Geralt and the World through two situations - the striga and Nivellen.

Of course the striga story reminds me of the Bloody Baron quest in the Witcher 3. I find it interesting how curses in this world are always born from intense misfortune and the resulting human hatred, not from some ultimate generic fantasy evil villain who wants to take over the world (maybe I watch too much shallow anime). Sapkowski specifies clearly that the striga curse was not born from incest, but from the stigma and condemning of King Foltest's incest with his sister by others. And Nivellen's curse was brought upon him by his raping of a priestess who likely had the knowledge to cast complex curses. Curses are messy and each one somewhat unique to the situation which give it a grisly realistic feel. It also reminds me of the idea in Supernatural where monsters can be conceived from believing in monsters, and same for the gods' power in Heaven Official's Blessing. 

Twists to fairytales are also a big part of the striga and Nivellen's stories. A redditor claimed that there are many short stories like these two that are inspired by little mermaid, the beauty and the beast, snow white, etc. Nivellen is clearly a twist on the beauty and the beast where true love cures te curse. Yet Verena, the "beauty" is a far greater beast than Nivellen. So why did her death cure Nivellen? And the striga is mostly slavic inspired ([Leslaw in 1847 written by Roman Zmorski](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T02NrgO8Vvs)) but has some hints of sleeping beauty. Later on Renfri with the seven gnomes reminds one of Snow White. 

Not only is there world building - the intertwining of complex human dynamics born from love and hatred with curses and monsters - but also the establishing of Geralt's unique position of authority within all of this as a professional. In both cases, Geralt is pulled aside quietly like a patient's parent would to a doctor and asked to relent his "witcher's code" and break the bad news to them. With the striga, he was asked about the risks and likelihood of the curing plan failing and how the princess would be afterwards. WIth Nivellen, he was asked whether his monstrous condition would inevitably consume him after having more and more ominous, violent dreams. 

Through these intriguing situations, Geralt's extraordinary character is on full display. He doesn't hesitate to cut the bullshit and lay down every fact that he knows and doesn't know even though they may be grim. These questions are clearly very dear to Nivellen and king Foltest's hearts, very painful to confront. And Geralt is strategic and logical - he considers even the scheming path offered to him to kill the striga and lie to King Foltest as a possible card to play before deciding there are no signs of the striga being a lost cause. And then comes his most admirable trait - he ends up curing the curses of both monsters instead of trying to kill them or abandoning them like all the other people in this world have done. The striga was festering and terrorizing for 7 years and even other witchers failed to put an end to the mess. Not anyone had the bravery or the ability to empathize with Nivellen's misfortune which only took Geralt a single encounter to do. When Geralt found Verena to be the cause of innocents' deaths and learned she was controlling Nivellen, he didn't hesitate to turn around, risk his life to kill her for no gain, and spare Nivellen.
