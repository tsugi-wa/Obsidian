- variety show in theatre
- comedy, music, juggling, large animals, tapdancers, strongmen, magicians, etc.
- lower class, raunchy humor but more respectable over time (vs burlesque/strip-tease )
- origin from France and 1800s minstrelsy (theater)
- commercial motion pictures render vaudeville obsolete
	- vaudeville theatres converted to film theatres,
	- very little authentic film record of vaudevilles
	- many didn't survive their fame after 1920s
- **influence:** 
	- in film, i.e. Charlie Chaplin who adapted vaudeville experience to film
	- in TV, Milton Berle acts

France and Paris simultaneous dev, “trick films”, moving bodies on stage like theater 
**Cinema of attraction**: eye candy not real plot /storytelling just amazed at moving animated images/innate spectacle
- The Gay Shoe Clerk 1903 closeup on ankle
- The Kiss 1898

Edwin S Porter new tech effects mimicking Melies 

Vs Theatrical (NOT attraction)
- Traditional stage design (mise-en-scene)
- Presence onstage (proscenium stage)
- Long shots
- Artificial sets
- Actors facing audienc

Shift to Narrative/Ideology 
- Perspective ie flattering/unflattering 
- Racism, capitalism, poverty, Charlie Chaplin 1917 immigrant culture 
- D W Griffin Birth of a Nation 1915 depicting black ppl controlling U.S. gov and doing repulsive things
	- Changing cameras, ppl looking up then clip to follow their gaze to balcony
	- Foreground background, put black guy’s bare feet on desk closer and other guy waving around chicken behind so extra repulsive
