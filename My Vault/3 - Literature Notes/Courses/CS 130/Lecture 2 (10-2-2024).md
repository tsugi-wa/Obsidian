## Software Process Models
- waterfall model (hardware)
	- strictly sequential, dont go forward or backwards
	- better for hardware, which is more expensive to change
	- **v-model:** always write test case with each step of waterfall
		- only go up testing AFTER reach bottom of v
- incremental model (all knowns)
	- break down major requirements into multiple increments of time + their expectations
	- can overlap (not strictly sequential)
	- **RAD model:** know exactly what is needed, dev. in parallel
- iterative (very unknown_)
	- rely heavily on customer response
	- hard to predict finish line
	- can lead to costly redesign!!!! 
	- **spiral model:** design doc.
