resume is flyer NOT holistic like linkedin, build brand w/ quality info
about: summarize achievements and aspirations, call to action? 
	statement: purposeful, inspiring, extremely personal unique, etc.

very upfront; admit I am not finance guy, but here I bleieve my skills are this and this in data analysis skills, so interview questions adjusted to be more data analytical 
behaviorial - specific challenge in this experience and what you learn
- understanding terms bring to interviewer's level not too technical in behavior etc. 
- exaggerate a specific dimension portraying yourself (upbeat college kid really enthusiastic to learn, take initiative, talk about example that highlights this)
