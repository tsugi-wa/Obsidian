# Defining "Distributed System"
1. set of "servers" that cooperate over a network, provide service?
2. group of interconnected (over network) computers (servers, nodes, etc.) coop & agree (protocols) to provide service
3. set of interacting components (msg standard, RPC, IO buffers protobuffs in Google) with specific I/O 

- interface: talking btwn nodes (abstraction not expose within nodes)
- **network vs bus**: 
	- bus: proprietary internal communication i.e. particular cpu/mobo
	- network: generalized
- coordination: common language/protocol agreement among nodes
	- if "set x=3" so propogate among nodes? read x while not done propogating x? 
- transparency: abstraction, just do some task
- distributed sys vs airlines (fault-tolerant) because all local bus (proprietary radio)
### Examples of implicit/explicit
- backends for popular apps - implicit uses
- DNS - implicit
- data processing (spark, flink) - explicit
- ML train (explicit), chatGPT (implicit)
- blockchain - distributed ledger
- online service games 
## subclass types
- high performance (sims, data processing)
- info/database (idnexigin)
- pervasive ubiquitous sys (IoT sensor network, security network sys i.e. cams)
- multiple birdhouse cams, all connect how?
	- all connect to one master (pt failure, aka SPOF)
	- all nodes caching (sensors shouldn't handle data)
	- gossip (all communicate via range, closest, until everyone gets same data)
## anatomy
- nodes - ipad, phone, robot, car, alexa, arduino. 
	- all susceptible to fialures. (mean time btwn failures)
- server
	- serves
	- balances workload
- databases:
	- tweets/videos into data sink (sucks data) --> filters to diff destination by type which may be more nested distrib. system
	- sharded architecture - not CDN aka store every copy on every country 
- network
	- controller at app-lvl talks with phone to keep you connected when walking btwn campus buildings
	- latency: time from node j to i sending
	- bandwidth: volume of data per sec
- storage
	- ssds fail spectacularly
	- hdds slow cheap 
	- file system partition distrib?  tailor paid services to use case
- types
	- computation, communication, storagi

# question
- one failure? 
- multiple failures? parallel? cascade? non-deterministic environment? long after deployment?
- order maintained? concurrency
- correctness? 
- resources? elascticity/scalability/performance
- bottleneck even w/ doubled nodes?
