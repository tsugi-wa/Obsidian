# Cloud Storage (i.e. AWS)
3 types
1. **==object store==** (AWS S3, GCP cloud storage, Dropbox, backups)
	- tons of unstructured data, flat (unlike hierarchy in normal file sys)
		- simulate directory with "prefix" to filename in bucket, some clients recognize as folder
	- for **data lakes** diverse data, long term data storage (archival logs, static assets for website)
	- not attached to single server or disk, standalone, flexible, for AWS logs
	- each file organized in **buckets** w/ unique name (across ALL of AWS not region)
	- buckets replicated **among** regions and **within** regions
		- among: spread across multiple regions
		- within: availability zone in case of geographic outage/locality in data center 
	- tradeoff/tiers
		- high perf low latency \$\$\$\$ (expensive to store)
		- infrequently accessed (move inactive users, more expensive to retrieval)
		- archival (rarely used data, dirt cheap, \$\$\$\$ retrieve i.e. in cave super slow)

	- nickel-diming pricing (always price to retrieve/egress data, free upload/ingress)
		- region (LA \$\$\$)
		- data (GBs/month, discounts)
		- num requests (every 1k PUT/COPY/POST/WRITE,  GET/SELECT)
		- storage class changes (every 1k) - auto intelligient tiers also \$\$\$
		- replication
		- Examples
			- store 50GB in standard, 100k files. Egress=500GB (i.e. retrieve 10 times, 1 million reads)
			- so: writes=100k writes. storage: 50GB in standard, standard pricing=.023/GB and .005/1k writes
			- ingress: 100k writes / 1k x $.005 + 50 GB(\$.023) = 1.65
			- egress: $.09(500GB) + 1M reads / 1k x \$.0004 = 45.4
			- total: $1.65+$45.4 = $47.05
		- lots of small files but total lots of GB = tons of writes, reads, \$\$\$\$
1. **==block lvl==** store (AWS EBS, GCP persistent disk)
	- like disk in computer, attached to server instance, needs mounting, partition, formatting
	- way faster than object storage like real SSD
	- classes w/ sub-versions (eras)
		- general purpose (SSD), practical, cost effective, IOPS not guaranteed
		- provisioned IOPS (faster, IOPS=I/Os per sec) - databases, production web servers
		- throughput optimized hdd - optimized for high thruput i.e. WD Purple
		- cold hdd = commodity hdd slow, cheap
	- pricing - even if unmounted or not associated with instance
		- region
		- storage class
		- num provisioned IOPS above baseline
		- thruput MB/s
		- i.e. small files = greater thruput and IOPS

1. distrib. file sys (AWS EFS, GCP Filestore)
