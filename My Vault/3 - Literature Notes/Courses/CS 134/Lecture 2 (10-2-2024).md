hard to debug mutlipel errors
network error can check via checksum, but cpu computation error cannot detect
insidious - spread over entire system if not stoped
transient? race conditions? time-based non-deterministic

**final exam tip:** best to avoid distrib. system unless very needed, might be single app sys

# Eight Fallacies of Distrib. Systems
1. network is reliable (leaky abstractions, TCP)
2. latency is 0 (even if super fast within data center)
3. bandwidth is infinite (assuming easily propogate data within nodes)
4. network secure
5. topology not change (no elasticity principle or scalability)
6. there's one admin (diff admins, diff goals, etc. ), or malicious admins/actors
7. transport cost is 0 (cloud)
8. network homogenous (old nodes, etc.)
