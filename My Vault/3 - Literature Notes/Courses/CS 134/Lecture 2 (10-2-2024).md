hard to debug mutlipel errors
network error can check via checksum, but cpu computation error cannot detect
insidious - spread over entire system if not stoped
transient? race conditions? time-based non-deterministic

**final exam tip:** best to avoid distrib. system unless very needed, might be single app sys

# Eight Fallacies of Distrib. Systems
1. network is reliable (leaky abstractions, TCP)
2. latency is 0 (even if super fast w)
