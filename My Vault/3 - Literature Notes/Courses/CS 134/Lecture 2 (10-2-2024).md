hard to debug mutlipel errors
network error can check via checksum, but cpu computation error cannot detect
insidious - spread over entire system if not stoped
transient? race conditions? time-based non-deterministic

**final exam tip:** best to avoid distrib. system unless very needed, might be single app sys

# Eight Fallacies of Distrib. Systems
1. network is reliable (leaky abstractions, TCP)
2. latency is 0 (even if super fast within data center)
3. bandwidth is infinite (assuming easily propogate data within nodes)
4. network secure
5. topology not change (no elasticity principle or scalability)
6. there's one admin (diff admins, diff goals, etc. ), or malicious admins/actors
7. transport cost is 0 (cloud)
8. network homogenous (old nodes, etc.)

Example:
- tried to scrape all of Facebook BFS
- **separation of concerns**: all in one python file: all stored in ram, scrape ppl & parse at same time
	- lots of data loss, bugs from unhandled exceptions, lost work queue (in RAM)
	- facebook return blocking/corrupted data
	- transient mem
	- **being rate limited via IP address, from pausing**
1. separate into scraper to disk + extracting friend list (processing)
2. work queue (Redis) in RAM, retry if failed add back to queue until TTL, and add recovery incase node failed
3. **Middleware:** separate sysetm that runs across multiple nodes, i.e. cloud to store all files in one place - in buckets i.e. AWS like folders but not nested

# Thought Experiments
**General Problem**; 
**Byzantine Generals**: 100% reliable messengers but possibly traitors (mislead other general)
- malicious generals can work together or be controlled by one dictator
- easier to solve w/ cryptography to prove what was said
