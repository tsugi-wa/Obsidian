Time uses
- scheduling jobs cos, Hadoop)
    - timeout & retry
    - failure detection
- measuring performance
- TTL caches, time-sensitive data
- Order of events-timestamp weak to internet down

Clock Types
- physical (analog = pendulum, digital = oscillating crystal)
    - crystal cheap, inaccurate, temp-dependent
    - atomic uses cesium-133 or rubidium, GPS
    - adjusted to match Earth's variations (GTC)
        - June 30 & Dec 31 ± leap sec every year (23:59:58 → 00:00:00 or 23:59:59 → 60 or nop)
        - OS livelock @ 23:59: 60 confusion, disrupts hr timer to think all sleeping processes were sleeping too long due to OS neglect, wakes them all, overloads CPU with callbacks in Java
        - CMOS battery counts time even if PC off, crashes badly if it fails
    - fixing clock skew: minor inaccuracies btwn 2 computers
        - NTP servers strotums:
        - 0: atomic clock
        - 1: Ntp server built atop 0
        - 2: everything else built atop 1
		- clock slew: gradually adjust client clock
