- consistency models:
	- network (async/sync)
	- fault/failure (RPC)
	- ordering models (causal)
	- delivery models (crash, omission)
- **TOTAL ORDER DELIVERY**
	- if m1 delivered before m2 on ONE mode, same for ALL nodes
	- only a property of ONE run, 
	- not enough - need **DETERMINISM** (every run same)
		- here: only 1 replica R so guarantees total order, but two possibilities not deterministic

- consistency violations among replicas
	- ==Read your writes==: writes to R1, reads from R2 (either load balance or R1 crash)
		- client writes 5, gets ACK, reads a 4?!??
		- solution: R1 replicates new written value before ACKing to client (**sync. replication**)
	- ==FIFO consistency==: client deposits $50 to R1, gets ACK, R1
