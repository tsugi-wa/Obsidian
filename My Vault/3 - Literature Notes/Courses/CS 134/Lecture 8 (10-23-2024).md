- consistency models:
	- network (async/sync)
	- fault/failure (RPC)
	- ordering models (causal)
	- delivery models (crash, omission)
- **TOTAL ORDER DELIVERY**
	- if m1 delivered before m2 on ONE mode, same for ALL nodes
	- only a property of ONE run, 
	- not enough - need **DETERMINISM** (every run same)
		- here: only 1 replica R so guarantees total order, but two possibilities not deterministic

- consistency violations among replicas
	- ==Eventual consistency==: one of weakest
		- "stale" data? device showing old msg as speed > consistency (more important), eventually see update (common in NoSQL, big data stores/sys, etc.)
		- i.e. ML reading slightly outdated weights to speed up training
	- ==Read your writes==: writes to R1, reads from R2 (either load balance or R1 crash)
		- client writes 5, gets ACK, reads a 4?!??
		- solution: R1 replicates new written value before ACKing to client (**sync. replication**)
	- ==FIFO consistency==: client deposits $50 to R1, gets ACK, R1
		- R2 gets in wrong order

	- ==Causal consistency==: know deposit -->withdrawal (happens-before relation) but other replication doedsn't see this relation
		- soln: vector clocks, causal broadcast, see prev. lecture

	- causal is usually good enough in practice
	- strong: \$\$\$\$, network I/O and time to ensure eplication + ACKs
	- ==**CAP theorem** (Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance)==
		- distrib. system can only support two of the three desired properties
	-  if partition failure: sacrifice either availiability (fast) or consistency (right), otherwise prioritize one or the other
