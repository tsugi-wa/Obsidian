# Syllabus
55% project
1. scratch MapReduce (low-lvl) in Go (intro)
2. primary/backup key-value service (not lose key-vals in nodes)
3. paxos-based key-value service (each node votes stale/new/ multi write version)
4. sharded key-value service (full distributed key-value service)

## Books
- course-boring-verbose (AFTER lecture): 
	Distributed Systems, by Maarten van Steen & Andrew S. Tanenbaum. Fourth Edition, Version 2. (Free PDF online)
- high-lvl understanding (BEFORE lecture): 
	Understanding Distributed Systems, by Robert Vitillo.
- highly recommend for app-lvl data job understanding:
	Designing Data-Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann. Published by Oâ€™Reilly.
- future research papers (BEFORE lecture)
	popular, timeless fundamentals not newest cutting edge tech

# Distributed System Definition
1. set of "servers" that cooperate over a network, provide service?
2. group of interconnected (over network) computers (servers, nodes, etc.) coop & agree (protocols) to provide service
3. set of interacting components (msg standard, RPC, IO buffers protobuffs in Google) with specific I/O 
- interface: talking btwn nodes (abstraction not expose within nodes)
- **network vs bus**: 
	- bus: proprietary internal communication i.e. particular cpu/mobo
	- network: generalized
- coordination: common language/protocol agreement among nodes
	- if "set x=3" so propogate among nodes? read x while not done propogating x? 
- transparency: abstraction, just do some task
- distributed sys vs airlines (fault-tolerant) because all local bus (proprietary radio)
